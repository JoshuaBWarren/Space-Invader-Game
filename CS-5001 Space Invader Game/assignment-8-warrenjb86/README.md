This was my first assignment for this class.  I thoroughly enjoyed
the challenged posed by it.  I hope it helps people learn how to code and,
more importantly, how to design well thought out code!

Known bugs:

- Sometimes space invader bullets pass through aliens to destroy aliens 
behind it.
- Hitting the mothership gives you a life but the mothership never
returns for more chances at gaining lives.
